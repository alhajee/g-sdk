* Added a setting to [FaceConfig]({{'/api/face/' | relative_url}}#FaceConfig) to save only the template without storing the actual image in the visual face.
* Added a setting to [detect_network_interval]({{'/gateway/config/' | relative_url}}#device-server).
* Improved usability in low-speed network environments:
  - Detecting device connection status, improving device reconnection wait time, etc.
